I am proud to announce that a site I recently built with the [Anchor Marketing & Design](http://anchormd.com) team in Fort Worth has been nominated for a CSS Award! The site was built for the [Fort Worth Food + Wine Festival](http://fortworthfoodandwinefestival.com) and launched about a month ago. Hats off to the Anchor team for a job well done!

Go ahead and check out the site at <http://fortworthfoodandwinefestival.com> and don't forget to vote for us on the [CSS Awards website](http://www.cssawards.net/nominee/fort-worth-food-wine-festival/)!
